# AIC Su2024
   this is a the labs and mini projects I have done in my training CMOS Analog IC Design summer 2024 under the supervision of Prof.Hesham Omran 
   
   it was a two month training I learn the fundamentals concept of Analog IC design (MOSFET models, single-stage and cascode amplifiers, frequency response, current mirror, differential amplifier,5T OTA) and gm/ID design methodology and advanced Analog IC design(Negative Feedback, stability and compensation, noise, CMFB, SR, PSRR, variability andmismatch, biasing and references) and this is the labs and mini project in this course we use gm/id design methodology to design our MOSFET and cadence and Xscheme and ADT(Analog Design Tools) to simulate and verify the analysis the behavior of the circuit
