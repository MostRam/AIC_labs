# Simple vs Wide Swing (Low Compliance) Cascode Current Mirror Rebort 
this is Simple vs Wide Swing (Low Compliance) Cascode Current Mirror lab we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to analysis the circuit and the lab has two parts
in this lab we
- Explore current mirror sizing trade-offs using Sizing Assistant (SA).
- Bias a cascode device using a series resistance.
- Design and simulate simple and wide swing (low-voltage) current mirrors.
- Compare simple and wide swing current mirrors.
- Investigate the effect of mismatch on a wide swing current mirror.


## part 1 Exploring Sizing Tradeoffs Using SA
In Part 1 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to use SA to examine current mirror design trade-offs.
- How to design a simple current mirror.

## part 2 Current Mirror Simulation
In Part 2 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our Simple and Wide Swing (Low Compliance) Cascode Current Mirror and learned
- How to design a wide swing (low-voltage) current mirror.
- How the behavior of a simple current mirror changes with the output voltage.
- How the behavior of a wide swing current mirror changes with the output voltage.
- The effect of mismatch on a wide swing current mirror.
