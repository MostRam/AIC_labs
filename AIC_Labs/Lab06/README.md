#Differential Amplifier Rebort 
this is Differential Amplifier lab we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to analysis the circuit and the lab has two parts
in this lab we
- Design a differential amplifier circuit using the Sizing Assistant (SA).
- Learn how to simulate the small-signal differential characteristics of a differential amplifier.
- Learn how to simulate the small-signal common-mode characteristics of a differential amplifier.
- Learn how to simulate the large-signal differential characteristics of a differential amplifier.
- Learn how to simulate the large-signal common-mode characteristics of a differential amplifier.


##part 1 Differential Amplifier Design
In Part 1 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to design a resistive-loaded differential amplifier.

##part 2 Differential Amplifier Simulation
In Part 2 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our Differential Amplifier and learned
- How to use an ideal balun to test a differential amplifier.
- How to simulate the small-signal differential gain of a differential amplifier.
- How to simulate the small-signal common-mode gain of a differential amplifier.
- How to simulate the large-signal differential characteristics of a differential amplifier.
- How to simulate the large-signal common-mode characteristics of a differential amplifier.
