#LPF Simulation and MOSFET Characteristics Rebort
this is the first lab during the course we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to analysis the circuit and the lab has two parts
in this lab we 
- Get familiar with Xschem/Ngspice, and ADT IC design tools.
- learned the different types of simulations (transient, ac).
- learned How to run parametric sweeps.
- Compare the behavior of PMOS and NMOS transistors.
- Compare the behavior of short-channel and long-channel MOSFETs.


##part 1 Low Pass Filter Simulation (LPF) 
In Part 1 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate LPF and learned
- the different types of simulations (transient, ac).
- How to run transient simulations.
- How to run ac-analysis simulations.
- How to run parametric sweeps.

##part 2 MOSFET Characteristics 
In Part 2 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to plot the transistors I/V characteristics using DC analysis.
- How to plot the transistors I/V characteristics using parametric sweeps.
- The difference in transistor characteristics between an NMOS and a PMOS transistor.
- The difference in transistor characteristics between a short-channel and a long-channel MOSFET.
- How the gm of the transistor behaves vs VGS.
