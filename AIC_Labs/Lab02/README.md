#Common Source Amplifier Rebort
this the second  labs in the cousre we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to analysis the circuit and the lab has two parts
in this lab we
- Design and simulate a common-source amplifier.
- Learn how to generate and use design charts.
- Investigate gain non-linearity, the variation of the gain with input signal amplitude.


##part 1 Sizing Chart
In Part 1 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to generate and use design charts for NMOS and PMOS transistors.
- How to design a resistive-loaded common-source amplifier.
- How the overdrive voltage of a MOS transistor deviates from the square law in different regions of operation.

##part 2 CS Amplifier
In Part 2 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our CS amplifier and learned
- How to do ac and DC simulations of a CS amplifier.
- How the gain of an amplifier changes with the input signal amplitude.
