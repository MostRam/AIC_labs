#Common Drain Frequency Response Rebort 
this is Common Drain Frequency Response lab we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to analysis the circuit and the lab has two parts
in this lab we
- Learn how to do ac, DC, and transient simulations of a CD amplifier.
- Investigate the ringing and peaking problem in a capacitive-loaded CD amplifier with a large signal
- source resistance (Rsig) and learn how to solve it.
- Use PMOS input transistor to avoid body effect in a CD amplifier.


##part 1 Sizing Chart Using ADT SA
In Part 1 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to design a PMOS common-drain amplifier.
- How to find transistor sizing using the Sizing Assistant (SA).

##part 2 CD Amplifier
In Part 2 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our CD amplifier and learned
- How to do AC, DC and transient simulations of a CD amplifier.
- How the peaking in the frequency response of a CD amplifier changes with the load capacitor and source resistance.
- How the ringing in the transient response of a CD amplifier changes with the load capacitor and source resistance.
- How the output impedance of a CD amplifier shows inductive behavior.
