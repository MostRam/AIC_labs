#Negative Feedback Rebort 
this is Negative Feedback lab we use cadence&Virtuoso to analysis the circuit and the lab has two parts
in this lab we
- Create a behavioral model for an OTA.
- Investigate negative feedback properties.
- Design a non-inverting amplifier using a 5T OTA.
- Learn how to simulate different views of the same cell.


##part 1 Feedback with Behavioral OTA
In Part 1 we used cadence&Virtuoso to simulate Feedback with Behavioral OTA and learned
- How to simulate a different view for the same cell. 
- How to generate a behavioral model of a 5T OTA.
- How to simulate a non-inverting amplifier with capacitive feedback using an ideal amplifier.
- How the closed-loop gain of the non-inverting amplifier is insensitive to the open-loop gain of the 5T OTA because of the negative feedback effect.

##part 2 Feedback with Real 5T OTA
In Part 2  we used cadence&Virtuoso to simulate Feedback with Real OTA and learned
- How to simulate a non-inverting amplifier with capacitive feedback using a real amplifier.
- How to compare the behavior of a non-inverting amplifier when using an ideal amplifier to a real one.
- How the closed-loop and open-loop gains of a non-inverting amplifier change with frequency.
