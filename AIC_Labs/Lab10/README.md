# Noise Simulation Rebort 
this is Noise Simulation lab we use cadence&Virtuoso to analysis the circuit and the lab has four parts
in this lab we
- Learn how to simulate noise in a LPF in both ac and transient simulations.
- Learn how to simulate noise in a 5T OTA in both ac and transient simulations.


## part 1 LPF AC Noise Analysis
In Part 1 we used cadence&Virtuoso to simulate AC Noise Analysis for LPF and learned
- How to do ac noise simulation of a LPF.
- How the rms noise change with the filterâ€™s resistor value.

## part 2 LPF Transient Noise Analysis
In Part 2 we used cadence&Virtuoso to simulate Transient Noise Analysis for LPF and learned
- How to do transient noise simulation of a LPF.
- The need for multiple transient simulation runs for plotting rms noise spectrum.

## part 3 5T OTA AC Noise Analysis
In Part 3 we used cadence&Virtuoso to simulate AC Noise Analysis for 5T OTA and learned
- How to do ac noise simulation of a 5T OTA.

## part 4 5T OTA Transient Noise Analysis
In Part 4 we used cadence&Virtuoso to simulate Transient Noise Analysis for 5T OTA and learned
- How to do transient noise simulation of a 5T OTA.
- The need for multiple transient simulation runs for plotting rms noise spectrum.
