#Cascode Amplifier Rebort 
this is Cascode Amplifier lab we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to analysis the circuit and the lab has three parts
in this lab we
- Use ADT IC design and SA tools in design to size transistors.
- Design and simulate single and cascode amplifier.
- Set bias current of the cascode amplifier.
- Investigate the gain, the bandwidth, and the GBW of a cascode amplifier


##part 1 Device Sizing using ADT SA
In Part 1 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to find transistor sizing using the Sizing Assistant (SA).
- How to design a common-source and a cascode amplifier.

##part 2 Cascode for Gain
In Part 2 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our current-source load CS&Cascode amplifier and learned
- How to build a testbench for a cascode amplifier with current-source load.
- How to use cascode to boost the amplifier’s gain.
- How to simulate the gain, the bandwidth and the GBW of a cascode amplifier with current-source load.

##part 3 “Optional” Cascode for BW
In Part 3 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our resistive load CS&Cascode amplifier and learned
- How to build a testbench for a cascode amplifier with resistive load.
- How to use cascode to boost the amplifier’s bandwidth.
- How to simulate the gain, the bandwidth and the GBW of a cascode amplifier with resistive load.
