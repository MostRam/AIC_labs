#Gm/ID Design Methodology Rebort 
this is Gm/ID Design Methodology lab we use XScheme&NGSpice and ADT to design 5T OTA and analysis the circuit and the lab has four parts
in this lab we
- Design and simulate a 5T OTA.
- Learn how to plot and use gm/ID design charts using ADT.
- Learn how to simulate open-loop/closed-loop characteristics of the 5T OTA using open-source tools.


##part 1 gm/ID design charts
In Part 1 we used ADT to generate the characteristics graph of MOSFET and learned
- How to plot and use the gm/ID design curves.

##part 2 OTA Design
In Part 2 we use our knowledge and graph from part 1 to design our 5T OTA and learned
- How to design and OTA that meets desired specifications.

##part 3 Open âˆ’ loop OTA simulation
In Part 3 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our open - loop OTA and learned
- How to simulate the small-signal differential gain of a 5T OTA in open-loop configuration.
- How to simulate the small-signal common-mode gain of a 5T OTA in open-loop configuration.
- How to simulate the large-signal differential characteristics of a 5T OTA in open-loop configuration.
- How to simulate the large-signal common-mode characteristics of a 5T OTA in open-loop configuration.

##part 4 Closed-Loop OTA Simulation
In Part 3 we used XScheme&NGSpice to simulate our closed - loop OTA and learned
- How to simulate the small-signal differential gain of a 5T OTA in closed-loop configuration.
- How to simulate the small-signal common-mode gain of a 5T OTA in closed-loop configuration.
- How to simulate the large-signal differential characteristics of a 5T OTA in closed-loop configuration.
- How to simulate the large-signal common-mode characteristics of a 5T OTA in closed-loop configuration.
